          all of your view logic for the buttons lies on a width of this element (container).
          If you were to increase the width here, your buttons would all be on the same row.
          To prevent this from happening, I would utilize combination of flex rows and flex columns
          (container is a flex with columns, +/- buttons are grouped in a div with flex rows, reset stays where it is)
